## JavaScript Basics

This repository was made in conjuction with the "Hello World" and "Variables" videos from my [JavaScript Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-bZZqlFS3T52sO8Kx5hU91Fw9Z0GeNp) playlist. 

#### Hello World

Learn how to source a JavaScript file into an HTML page. Learn how to console log values and see the results. Both are essential to testing out any JavaScript concepts you learn. 

#### Variables

Variables gives our programs the ability to make functionality that is generalized and can preform the same tasks on different input or varying/variable input.
